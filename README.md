# A Personal and Professional Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I wanted to create a simple website to illustrate my
ability to continue learning and growing as a developer, and showcase some of the things I've learned as I've been working with React. This website is
intended as something of a more in-depth business card to interested recruiters or companies.
