                    After graduating from high school, I served for six years in the United States Navy as a language analyst. I was honorably discharged from the Navy in
                    2011, I began attending Colorado State University, where I earned a degree in Languages, Literatures, and Cultures with a German concentration. The career
                    prospects with that degree were not what I had hoped, and so I made the decision to return to school and pursue a second degree. I enrolled in Front Range
                    Community College in Fort Collins, where I was planning to get a web design certificate. However, I ended up taking a Computer Science I course, and I fell
                    in love with programming and with Computer Science. During my two years at Front Range, I worked as a teacher's assistant for Computer Science I and II. The
                    opportunity to teach really helped me to cement all of the fundamentals of object oriented programming, and helped me learn skills in technical communication.

                <br />
                <p>
                    From there, I transferred to Colorado State University, where I completed my bachelor's degree in Applied Computing Technology in the Computer Science Department. 
                    I returned to work at an office where I had worked during my first degree, this time as a Web Designer for the office's WordPress website. I utilized the WordPress 5, 
                    Elementor editor, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to rebuild the website from an older version. Due to the pandemic, all of the local internship opportunities available to 
                    me were cancelled. However, I worked hard to hone my skills on my own, using LinkedIn Learning and relying on professional connections to learn skills such as ReactJS, 
                    as well as expanding my knowledge of JavaScript and WordPress.

                <p>
                    After a cross-country move, I am now seeking a full-time or part-time position in the tech field. I am amenable to many different kinds of work, and am more focused
                    on finding a team or organization that is doing work motivated by a clear mission.
